Data Dictionary

1: id - the id of the subject performing the activity
2: activity - a description of the activity being performed, a factor variable with 6 levels:
        walking, upstairs, downstairs, sitting, standing, laying. Note that "upstairs" and "downstairs"
        indicate "waliking upstairs" and "walking downstairs", respectively.

Each of the next 66 variables represents either a mean of means, or a mean of standard deviations of an average of 57.2 
measurements of the constituent variable selected from the Samsung data. These measurements were either in the 
time for frequency domain, measured body or gravity components and were in the X, Y or Z axis (where appropriate).

To keep variable name length reasonable, the variables were encoded using concatenated text in camel caps format:
 - "time" or "freq" to indicate time or frequency domain
 - "Body" or "Gravity" to indicate the component
 - the name of the particular measurment (e.g. "GyroJerkMag" for Gyroscope Jerk Magnitude), possble entries in 
        this part of the name include:
                -"Acc" : accelerometer
                -"Jerk" : refers to a measurment of jerk motion
                -"Mag" : magnitude
                -"Gyro": gyroscope measurement
 - "Mean" or "Std" to indicate whether the column is a mean of means or a mean of standard deviations 
 - "X","Y", or "Z" to indicate the axis of measurment where appropriate

There are a total of 180 observations - one for each of the 30 subjects performing each of 6 activities.

All of these values are numeric and have been regularized so that their range is [-1,1]
